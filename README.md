# Project objective
> The aim of the project is to implement a gambling game called "Blackjack". The game is based on a deck of 36 cards (6-A).
# Installation
> Write in terminal: `git clone https://github.com/5t4lk/blackjack`.
# How to run
> Enter to folder named "blackjack". Write in terminal: `go run .\cmd\app\main.go`.
# Description
> Initially, the player is asked about the size of his deposit. As he plays, the balance may change. The player is also asked to place a bet after making a deposit. The player cannot place a bet above his balance. The player is given the choice of whether he wants to play - if the player agrees, the game begins. If the player does not agree, the game stops, the software shuts down and the player's balance reverts to $0.00. Enjoy the game.
