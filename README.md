# How to run

# Description
> Initially, the player is asked about the size of his deposit. As he plays, the balance may change. The player is also asked to place a bet after making a deposit. The player cannot place a bet above his balance. The player is given the choice of whether he wants to play - if the player agrees, the game begins. If the player does not agree, the game stops, the software shuts down and the player's balance reverts to $0.00. Enjoy the game.
