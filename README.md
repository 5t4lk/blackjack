# Project objective
> The aim of the project is to implement a gambling game called "Blackjack". The game is based on a deck of 36 cards (6-A). A player balance is introduced.
# Installation
> git clone https://github.com/5t4lk/blackjack
# How to run
> Write in console: `go run .\cmd\app\main.go`.
# Functionality 
> Initially, a player is given $100.00 to balance. As he plays, the balance may change. A constant bet of $5.00 is introduced in the game. The player is given the choice of whether he wants to play - if the player agrees, the game begins. If the player does not agree, the game stops, the software shuts down and the player's balance reverts to the initial $100.00. Enjoy the game.
